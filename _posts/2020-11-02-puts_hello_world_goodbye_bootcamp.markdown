Six months ago I had no idea what ```puts``` was let alone that the above title would be taking two arguments( in this case strings) and putting them into my console. Get why they call it puts? Puts == Put String. Now here I am looking at the first line of code I wrote and writing it again to introduce myself to the world. 

I am a software developer. I know how to write code, I know how to read code, and more importantly I know I can learn any new language, framework, stack quickly. If you are just beggining your journey it may seem impossible, but you too will end up where I am now.


## Where to now?

The answer is who knows, and that is ok. There are so many different directions a bootcamp grad can go in. It feels like choosing what you want to major in college. What I do know is that you can't get anywhere without putting one foot in front of the other. Personally I will be dipping my toe into the water by working with my cohort mates on pro-bono works for non-profits and opensource. I figure the best way to end the infinite loop of needing experience to get a job, and needing a job to get a experience was to create the job myself. Plus I don't think it hurts to get some real world experience working on a real project with others.
