They call it the first mile of your journey. Whether this is a journey to a new you, a new lifepath, new career, or just a new everything. This can seem like a terrifying yet somehow inspiring obstacle and goal at the same time. 

As I went through the first mile I can say that I went through the gamut of emotions: defeat, elation, fear, bravery.  I would raise my hands victorious, pumping my fists, and dance around the room after conquering a single line of code. This same line of code broke me down just a few minutes before, and the next line of code might cast the seeds of doom and gloom back into my life. Was I going to complete the tasks set ahead of me? Would I find the courage to continue my journey learning something that had defeated me in the past? 

These are all questions that can defeat a person, we mire ourselves in self-doubt. We tell ourselves that those strong words of conviction, the tired all powerful inspirational quote someone just read to us, will never work for us. Yet at some point during these two weeks I stopped doubting that I would be able to pass the next test in my Rspec file. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I still lived in moments of negative, and I stayed too long. In fact I know over the next four and half months of my journey I will experience the pains of what you should all know is positive growth.

I  know that each step of this journey has had an uncountable amount of steps before it. This is not a journey to a new me, a new lifepath, and a new everything. This is a continuation of my life. This is just a side quest that will make my character better equipped to encounter whatever obstacle appears next in my path. 

Stay tuned for less talking, and more coding because this is about to get real.
